# React DND Menu Builder 🚀

React DND Menu Builder is a user-friendly drag-and-drop menu builder for React, inspired by the simplicity and flexibility of the WordPress menu builder. It allows you to create and customize menus by dragging and dropping items from a list of available options, just like in WordPress. You can easily add, remove, and rearrange items to suit your needs.
